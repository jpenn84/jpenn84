## 🚀 About Me
I'm a QA Automation Engineer who specializes in Java ☕ and Selenium 🤖. I'm working to branch out and expand my skillset to cover full-stack development and desktop application development.

I'm also taking a foray into C programming, using the X11 and Motif libraries to tie into 2 of my other hobbies: electronics 🔋 and model trains 🚂, with a goal to create CTC (Centralized Traffic Control) system for train routing, an ATC (Automatic Train Control) system to run the trains, and a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system to monitor power. It will be loosely based on several brands of these systems which are used all over the world.

When I'm not at the keyboard ⌨️, you can find me at the... keyboard 🎹 (or the guitar🎸). I love to dabble in music writing and production, even though I'm not very good at it.

I'm also in my workshop 🛠️ a lot, doing woodworking 🪚 and tinkering 🪛. Sometimes, I'm even sewing 🪡🧵!
